## Setting up the environment
There are three options for setting up the environment for scBONITA2:
1. **Docker**: This is the easiest and most reliable method
2. **Conda**: This requires you to install a version of conda and create an scBonita conda environment. 
For Mac users with the M1 series chip, use the Docker instructions or download packages individually.
3. **Manually install packages**: This will take a bit longer, but will get around issues with creating the environment.
